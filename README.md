# Obstacle-Dodger-Course-Project-1-
Welcome to my first unity game!

Controls:

W/S — to go forward/backward.

A/D — to go left/right.

You can also change control inversion, mode, movement and rotation speed via game options.

You can play it here: https://mordredapcelwydd.itch.io/obstacle-dodger

Sometimes you may witness strange car behaviors, the reason for it is the fact that the game doesn't have proper physics implementation.
